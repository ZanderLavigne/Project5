                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Zander Lavigne, and it's a pleasure to meet you! I am currently a first-year IT Systems and Security student at NSCC Truro Campus, located in the picturesque town of Truro, Nova Scotia. As a passionate learner and aspiring IT professional, my journey in the world of technology is just beginning, and I am excited about the endless possibilities this field offers.

                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable hands-on experience through various work positions. I worked as a Nighttime Milker at Meadowland Farms from 2020 to 2022, where I developed teamwork skills and adapted to the challenges of working night shifts. Currently, I am actively engaged as a Grill/Counter Worker at the Stewiacke Dairy Queen, where I not only contribute to kitchen operations but also enjoy interacting with customers, honing my multitasking abilities.

                    In addition to my academic and work commitments, I am proud of my achievements in the 4-H community, where I have received several awards, including being nominated for the HEH Top Senior 4-H Member of the Year in 2023 and securing the Antigonish Farmers Mutual Scholarship Award.

                    I believe in the power of continuous learning and growth, both personally and professionally. As I navigate through my academic and professional endeavors, I am eager to explore new technologies, enhance my skills, and contribute positively to the world of IT.

                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I am always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations. Let's connect and share our experiences on this exciting journey of learning and discovery!
